# ðŸ§  What is a Neural Network?
 ## At its simplest, a neural network is just a function that tries to learn a pattern in data.
 ## Letâ€™s build a neural network to predict output y from input x â€” for example:
 ```
    Input (x):    0   1   2   3
    Output (y):   0   2   4   6

 ```
  ## You can see:
ðŸ‘‰ This is just `y = 2x.`

Letâ€™s now make a neural network learn this from scratch.
